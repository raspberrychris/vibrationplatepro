Hi welcome to [Cat Tree Guide](https://cattreeguide.com), my name is Percy and I am the proud owner of a beautiful long fur Siberian Cat called Pacha.  I have used many Cat trees over the years and thought it would be a good idea to start a website that reviewed only the best cat trees.   

My reviews and guides are my honest opinion of these products.

### Customers Say about this product

> I purchased this hammock a year ago and it's still going strong. My cats have never cared about any other bed I've ever bought but theyve taken to this one immediately. There's a 100% chance that there is at least one cat in this hammock if they're not in the other room with me.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Cat-Approved: Your kitty will love this scratcher, as it's covered in catnip or something similar.|👉 Chew proofing: It would be nice if this was made out of a material that cats couldn't easily chew through or scratch.|
| 👉 Easy Assembly: All parts are included and labeled, so you shouldn't have any trouble putting it together.|👉 Size: It's a little small and my cats have already outgrown it. I wish it was just a bit larger so they could enjoy it for longer.|
| 👉 Good Construction: This scratcher is well-made and should last for a long time.|👉 Sturdiness: Can tip over if Cat is playing with it vigorously.|

### Our Rating For This Product

It is a good cat tree and I recommend it to everyone.
In general, It is sturdy and lasts a long time, especially with a heavy cat. The color is good. The durability is not great but good enough. There are a few places my cat can get through it. Screws are not needed for assembly and it takes around 2 hours for the average person to put together. Assembly is easy, but does take some time.

### Customers Say about this product

> First off, this house is much smaller than it looks. Several of the pictures have photoshopped cats that are smaller in scale than the house. My kittens were 8 weeks old when I bought this and they fit fine.

|-|-|
| 👉 The house is small and kittens can easily fit in it.|👉  Kittens grow quickly and may outgrow this house|
| 👉  It has two upper perches which are stable and give the cats a place to play and relax.|👉  The house is smaller than it looks in pictures |
| 👉  The box that the perches mount on is not very stable, but it does not break easily and does not injure the cats.|👉  Stability in the upper perches could be better|

### Product Description 

The AIWIKIDE Cat Tree offers a comfortable and spacious home for your cat. It has three levels for your cat to climb up and down, providing them with an excellent place to scratch, sleep and play.

It also lets cats watch the view outside the window or just take in the view from high up.

### Our Rating For This Product

The instructions could be a little more clear, but it was pretty easy to put together. It's not the most stable thing in the world and can wobble a bit when my 1-year-old runs at it, but it's doing the trick so far. I'll probably try to secure it to the ground/wall once I get the tools.

> The tree itself looks nice and seems to be very sturdy. The top bed is very cushy. My son put it together for me and it took him about 1/2 hour. He said it was not bad at all.

### Our Rating For This Product

I'm giving this tree five stars because each of my cats love it. It's a great size for my apartment, and best of all, it doesn't look tacky! My two more timid cats hide away in the house all the time, but they both went up and down the cat tree without fear. I think they figured out how fun it was to be on high furniture! I've had no problem with scratching the carpet either. The posts are solid and the design is attractive. It was easy enough to put together

### Customers Say about this product

> Fairly easy to put together once you can figure out how the bottom goes. There are three holes and they are only slightly different lengths apart. So getting the right posts in the right holes so the hideaway fits was tricky for me…could have been just me.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Three cats can use it at the same time: This tree is big enough for three cats to use at the same time, which is great if you have multiple pets. |👉  Difficult to Assemble: One of the potential cons of this cat tree is that it may be difficult to assemble. There are three holes and they are only slightly different lengths apart, so getting the right posts in the right holes so the hideaway fits can be tricky|
| 👉  Hammock: The hammocks on this tree are a hit with my cats, and they love lounging in them.|👉  Not Suitable for All Cats: This cat tree is smaller, so it may not be suitable for all cats. Some larger cats may not be able to fit in the hide-a-way|
| 👉 Hide-a-way feature: My scaredy cat loves being able to hide away in this tree when she feels overwhelmed or nervous.|👉  May Not Be Durable: Another potential con is that this cat tree may not be as durable as other options on the market because it is smaller and made of lighter materials|

### Product Description 

This multi-level cat furniture will keep your indoor cat happy, healthy and entertained for hours. The BestPet 54in Cat Tree Tower for Indoor Cats provides a multitude of playful and comfortable places to rest or play. Each level offers multiple perches and a plushy condo where your kitty can curl up and sleep. There is also a sturdy sisal pole that they can scratch on if they desire. The BestPet Cat Tree is made from high-quality materials with skin-friendly faux fur all over.

### Our Rating For This Product

I really enjoy this cat tree tower. It's well made, and it's sturdy enough to handle my two playful cats. The fabric is really soft and high quality. I was worried the kittens would make a mess of it, but they haven't yet! The scratching post is thick and sisal in an excellent location, giving them an option to scratch when they want. I like the interaction the cat tree tower has with the rest of my living room décor. One thing I've noticed is that if you have long hair, watch out for getting it caught on the plushy material on the lounging/sleeping areas.

> My kittens love to play with it when I put them on top but they still prefer regular boxes lol. All of the piece came in and arrived earlier than expected :)

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 It's well made and sturdy enough to handle two playful cats.|👉  Not all cats will use it: If you have more than one cat, there's no guarantee they'll both take to the cat tree tower.|
| 👉 The fabric is really soft and high quality. |👉  It can be unstable: The cat tree tower is top-heavy, so if your cats are climbing on it a lot or playing too roughly, it can tip over. This has happened to me twice already!
|
| 👉 The scratching post is thick and sisal in an excellent location, giving them an option to scratch when they want|👉  It sheds: Like all plushy fabrics, the fabric on the cat tree tower will shed over time as your cats scratch and play on it. This can leave your furniture and floors covered in fur if you're not careful |

### Our Rating For This Product

My cats are seriously in love with this cat tree. The hammock is too small for my two cats, but they regularly find their way onto the hammock. I ended up re-assembling it located on the central pole of the scratch pad, because otherwise the weight caused the structure to lean. It's much more sturdy in that configuration.

| 👉  It's sturdy: Even though I had to reassemble it, once I did it seems to be holding up well against the weight of the cats using it.|👉 Unattractive Design: This cat tree has an unattractive design that looks cheaply made|
| 👉  The hammock is a good size for them: It's not too big or too small for our cats, and they seem to really like using it as a place to lounge around and take naps.|👉 May be too small for some bigger cats|

### Product Description 

TSCOMON's cat tree is designed to be stable and safe. The cat tower has 3 resting areas where cats can play, rest or perch. The cat condo provides enough space for 1-2 kittens, the sleeping basket provides comfortable sleeping space and the hammock is a secure place for cats to rest their weary heads. This versatile cat tree meets all the life needs of your indoor cats.

### Our Rating For This Product

If you are looking for a tall Cat Tree that your cats can use to look out of a window, this one will fit the bill. In fact, it's so tall, we ended up taking the top tier off - it was too high up! The height also makes it seem a bit wobbly, but it does come with a strap, which is easy enough to secure to the wall. Aesthetically, the direction diagrams are alright, but could be more clear with regards to all the parts and where they're supposed to go. If your cat is a big baby and sits on his backside, he may not fit well on the flat part if you leave the top tier on.

### Customers Say about this product

> This was fairly easy to put together, took about 30 minutes. My cat almost immediately jumped right on it, he loves it! His favorite part is the very top perch! For being over 5 feet tall it is surprisingly very sturdy. He will jump from my bed (which is about 3 feet away) all the way to the top perch and it will wobble a bit but has never fallen over!

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |

### Our Rating For This Product

My cat loves this product. To give you some background I have a cat who follows me around like he'll implode if he's more than two feet away from my feet.  He sniffed around the base and then tried to climb and then he just settled in. I watched him for a while, and he was purring like crazy. He can't go a day without using his new tree.

### Customers Say about this product

> My cat loves to bake his old bones in direct sunlight. This is his favorite spot right in front of the window. I set it up and waited til the right time of day (morning sun) to show him his new sunny spot and he loved it immediately. My other cat loves the scratcher posts below it. Definitely a good buy for them.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉  The cat likes it!|👉 Not durable: The construction of the cat tree is a little on the light side, which means it may not be able to withstand a lot of wear and tear.|
| 👉 The kitty uses it daily and likes taking naps on it.|👉 May be unstable: Because the construction is not very sturdy, there is a risk that the cat tree could topple over if it is knocked into or if your cat jumps onto it with too much force. |
| 👉 It is a good height for the cat to sit on and look out of the window.|👉 Scratch posts are unnecessary: The included scratch posts are unnecessary because most cats will probably not use them.|

### Product Description 

FEANDREA Cat Tower is made of high-quality, eco-friendly and pet-safe materials. The cat tower is not only a cat tree, but also a scratching post and a perch. It has two top perches that are filled to the brim with soft padding to provide comfort for your cats. The scratching board is also a ramp and it can be used by cats as a ladder to climb up and down easily. The cat area has plenty of room for larger cats.

### Our Rating For This Product

My cat loves this tree. Up top, there's a little hammock and even a hole for hiding. The bottom is covered in a soft carpet for lounging on. There are ample dangling toys, including one that hangs right in the middle of the tree. The top of the tree has a plush pad with a tunnel leading to the bottom. All in all, this is a good quality tree that my cat seems to really enjoy - and at this price, it's worth it.

### Customers Say about this product

> This is a good-looking Cat Tower or, as I prefer, Cat Condo. But my two cats are too big for it. My brother and sister cats weigh 15lbs and 13lbs respectively.

### Our Rating For This Product

It is a very sturdy, good looking tower and I would highly recommend it. Assembly took 10 minutes and the instructions were easy to follow.

I have seen some "cheapo" towers in other people's homes that are poorly made and look tatty, so I was surprised at how well the instructions were. I built up quite a bit of trust with amazon basics brand over the years, either with pet things or cables, kitchen things. The one thing that is consistent is there are few bells and whistles, but what you get is reliably and robustly made. This tower takes up a lot of room, but it was worth the purchase.

### Product Description 

A cat tree for larger cats, this cat tower features a widened perch and is filled to the brim with edges to ensure your cats can stretch out comfortably. With a scratching board and a ladder in one, this two-in-one scratcher helps your cats scratch their itch or get up if they're elderly or have mobility issues. Made with 2 doors, this cat cave lets you easily let your cat in and out of the fluffy cave or go to the basket.

### Our Rating For This Product

This cat tower is the best purchase I've made for my cat. I wanted him to be able to easily get to a window sill we have and he could get to the second level, but then he couldn't get to the top because the oversized bed hung too far over. So, I took the top off and put that piece on the floor. He loves sleeping in it (on the floor) and can still get to the window sill when he wants to using the 2 levels left.

### Customers Say about this product

> Our 11 mo old kittens love every square inch of this. They even use the hammock.  One perches on the top and the other perches on the second tower. I do notice that the tower posts will wobble so I tend to turn them tighter for stability.
